# Process Management

Processes are running programs identified by **PID**.

## Viewing Processes

- `ps aux` → snapshot  
- `top` → real-time monitoring  

## Controlling Processes

- `kill PID` → terminate  
- `SIGTERM` → graceful stop  
- `SIGKILL` → forced stop  

Understanding processes is critical for:

- incident response  
- performance tuning  
- malware detection
